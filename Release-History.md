### Version 1.40.0 (5 Dec 2018)
- üéâ New:
  * Support for [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/) libraries.
  * PDF Renderer (`io.scanbot.sdk.process.PDFRenderer`) - A new simple and convenient API for PDF rendering. Now with support for PDF page sizes (e.g. A4, US Letter, etc.) See the docs [[Creating PDF Documents]] for more details.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes:
  * **AndroidX**: Since AndroidX fully replaces the Android Support Libraries (`com.android.support.*`, etc), you will have to migrate your project to AndroidX. See ["Migrating to AndroidX"](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) for more details.
  * Internal Storage: The Scanbot SDK now uses the internal storage by default, which is more secure and do not require storage permission prompts. See the docs [[Storage]] for more details about the storage system. Please note: In case your app is using the storage for RTU UI Pages as permanent storage, make sure to implement a suitable migration (E.g. move the archived `Page` images from external storage folder to the new internal storage. Or alternatively overwrite the storage to the external folder again).
  * OCR blobs handling: A new mechanism and API to handle OCR language files as well as other blob files (MRZ blobs, etc) as assets. It replaces the obsolete mechanism based on `fetch()` methods (`blobManager.fetch(..)`). See the docs [[Optical Character Recognition]] for more details.

- üöÄ Improvements:
  * Support for `RGBA_F16` Bitmaps (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#RGBA_F16). Auto conversion to compatible Bitmaps.
  * Updated some third-party libs to the latest versions (e.g. Kotlin 1.3.0, etc).
  * Cleaned up some dependencies to avoid potential conflicts on implementation.

  * Please note that only the **new created** image files will contain extensions. The **currently available** image files in the temporary storage of the Scanbot SDK
    **will not get** file extensions and may become inaccessible. So please make sure to implement a suitable migration mechanism.
  * If you need backwards compatibility, you can disable the file format extensions via `PageStorageSettings.addImageFileFormatExtension(false)` on initialization of the SDK (`new ScanbotSDKInitializer().usePageStorageSettings(new PageStorageSettings.Builder().addImageFileFormatExtension(false).build())...`).
