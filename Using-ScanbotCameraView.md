Although Scanbot SDK provides out-of-the-box UI components such as `CameraFragment` and `SnappingActivity`, they are rather limited in terms of customization. If you found yourself in a such situation then you should use camera directly.

Android camera API might be very tricky and far from being developer-friendly (in fact, very far). To help you skip same issues as we encountered while developing Scanbot we created `ScanbotCameraView`.
