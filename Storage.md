Since version **1.40.0** the Scanbot SDK for Android uses the internal storage by default.
All files generated by the Scanbot SDK (images, PDF files, thumbnails, temp files, etc.) are stored in the application data directory.
Using the internal storage provides following benefits:
- all stored files are accessible by only your app
- does not require storage permission prompts for your users.

## Change the default storage directory
It is strongly recommended to use the internal storage. However, you can overwrite the default storage directory of the Scanbot SDK on initialization.
The `ScanbotSDKInitializer` class provides the method `sdkFilesDirectory(Application application, File sdkFilesDirectory)` which allows to change the default storage directory.

Example:
```
import io.scanbot.sdk.ScanbotSDKInitializer;

// e.g. use a sub-folder in the external(!) storage.
File customStorageDir = new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), "my-custom-storage-dir");
customStorageDir.mkdirs();

new ScanbotSDKInitializer()
        .sdkFilesDirectory(this, customStorageDir)
        ...
        .initialize(this)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** When overwriting the default storage location, make sure
- you have implemented a suitable storage permissions request handling
- the storage directory is available (e.g. unmounted SD card).
